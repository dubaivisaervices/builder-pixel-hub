My domain is incorrectly pointing to Fly.dev servers instead of my Hostinger hosting. Specifically, it's pointing to:

1. **Remove ALL Fly.dev configurations** from my domain
2. **Delete any CNAME records** pointing to Fly.dev
3. **Remove any URL forwarding** to Fly.dev
4. **Clear any subdomain redirects** to Fly.dev
5. **Set nameservers to Hostinger ONLY:**
   - ns1.dns-parking.com
   - ns2.dns-parking.com

**VERIFICATION:**
My domain should point ONLY to Hostinger hosting. Currently:

- ‚úÖ test.php loads from Hostinger (correct)
